This is the documentation for the 26 pin connector on the car harness.

The car harness currently supports Honda Nidec, Honda Bosch, and Toyota. We would like to support more cars in the future.

Pull requests for additional pin outs are welcome. Please reference the open_pinout.sch.pdf file for adding new cars. This will guarantee the harness will work properly.
